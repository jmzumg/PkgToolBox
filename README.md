## ü§ù Contributions Welcome!

**Contributions to the development are welcome!** If you have any ideas üí° on how to improve the code, feel free to:

- ‚úâÔ∏è Message me privately on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/SeregonWar)
- üîß Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/)
- üêõ Report an issue through [Issues](https://github.com/)

Currently, I am the only developer üë®‚Äçüíª and handling all the work can be challenging. Any support is greatly appreciated! üôå

**P.S.** if you are able to use the OpenOrbis sdk you could be really useful. I would like to create a version of this application that can run directly on PlayStation so that I can manipulate pkg files directly from there! Contact me! ;)

## Description
PS4 PKG Tool is a tool for manipulating PS4 PKG files. It allows you to extract, inject, modify, and obtain information about PKG files.

## Features
- **Extraction**: Extract specific files from a PKG.
- **Injection**: Inject new data into an existing PKG file.
- **Modification**: Modify the header of a PKG file.
- **Dump**: Perform a complete dump of the contents of a PKG.
- **Information**: Obtain detailed information about a PKG file.
- **File Explorer**: Navigate and manage files within the PKG using an integrated file explorer.
- **Hex Reader**: View and edit files in hexadecimal format.
- **Text Reader**: View and edit text files.
- **Delete**: Delete files from the PKG.
- **Trophy Management**: Load, read, and manage trophy files.
- **Integration with OpenOrbis**: Utilize `orbis-pub-cmd.exe` for advanced PKG manipulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- PyQt5
- pyinstaller and cx_freeze (for creating the executable)
- `orbis-pub-cmd.exe` (included in the OpenOrbis toolchain)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/seregonwar/PS4-PKG-Tool-Box.git
    cd PS4-PKG-Tool-Box
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure `orbis-pub-cmd.exe` is located in the `OrbisLibrary` directory:
